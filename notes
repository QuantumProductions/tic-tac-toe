API calls wrap server inside them

object = server.relevantFunction
res.json(object);

Clicking to move:
 *should send the message to the local server object, which updates the game and returns a JSON
 *should send the message to the remote server, which passes to its local server object, which updates the game and returns a JSON
 *local move updates the game from JSON
 *remote move updates the game from JSON
 *local move updates the game from remote's local JSON
